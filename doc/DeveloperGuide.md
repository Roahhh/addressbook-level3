## Appendix A : User Stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have)  - `* *`,  Low (unlikely to have) - `*`


Priority | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can...
-------- | :-------- | :--------- | :-----------
`* * *` | new user | see usage instructions | refer to instructions when I forget how to use the App
`* * *` | user | add a new person |
`* * *` | user | delete a person | remove entries that I no longer need
`* * *` | user | edit a person | correct or update a person's details
`* * *` | user | find a person by name, number or email | locate details of persons without having to go through the entire list
`* *` | user | view all entries | to have a quick overview of who is in the addressbook
`* *` | user | hide [private contact details](#private-contact-detail) by default | to minimize chance of someone else seeing them by accident
`*` | user with many persons in the address book | sort persons by name | locate a person easily
